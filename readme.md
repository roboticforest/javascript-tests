# JavaScript Tests

Welcome to my JavaScript language tests!

## About

I've always created small, self-contained tests when learning a new programming languages or feature, going all the way back to when I was a kid. I can't recommend enough how valuable it is to make these yourself. The depth of learning you get when trying your damnedest to break a system is invaluable!

I used to not keep these tests. Curiosity satisfied, I'd often just chuck 'em, but... after having had to remake quite a few over the years, I've learned the hard way that they make great notes.

This repository serves as a place to store and share these tests (specifically for JavaScript), so please feel free to explore, learn, and use them as a reference of your own.

## Running the Tests

The easiest way to run these tests is with Node.js. Clone the repo and run any script using:

```bash
node filename.js
```

The real value is in reading the code and comments though.
